## Introduction
My React project outlines some of my favorite resources that I use for a variety of things. In my landing page I introduce the users to my page and have made small functionality with state to handle for a form being submitted with the users name. After the form has been submitted it triggers a function that will alert the user with a thank you message, inlcuding the users name entered from the form. There is a navbar that is fluid on every page for navigtion on every page. I included links to pages and books that I have and love. I did not use the lifecycle methods for any API calls because I don't know how to call on apis that aren't open for the public without having to pay something.. ** would like to have a lesson on this before I embark on that weather api lesson!

## Usage
load multipage in your terminal and then use the navbar to navigate through the pages!

## Installation
Select the folder, open in VS code, run your terminal, and then start the node package manager.
